#Geo Lens: Earth Observation Data for Agricultural Insights

Geo Lens is a web application designed to help farmers and landowners make informed agricultural decisions using Earth observation data. Leveraging geolocation technology, the platform provides real-time environmental insights specific to a user's location, such as soil type, water quality, weather conditions, and crop recommendations. Geo Lens integrates NASAâ€™s Earth Observation data and the OpenEPI API for soil analysis, offering users an intuitive and accessible interface to explore location-specific data. By displaying critical information like the most probable soil type and its properties, the platform helps users understand their land better and optimize agricultural productivity.

Built using Django for backend management and JavaScript for dynamic frontend updates, Geo Lens aims to make advanced environmental data available and actionable for everyone, promoting sustainable agriculture practices.
